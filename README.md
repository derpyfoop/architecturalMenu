First Java project at BCC.

The architecturalMenu program provides three services that can be accessed through a command-line menu.

The first option calculates the cost of designing a house based on the square footage inputted by the user.

The second option presents a list of 3D model options, with the user selecting one to see its associated cost.

The third option displays a list of construction drawings, where the user can select multiple items, separated by commas, and the program calculates the total cost.

After selecting an option, the program will display the cost of the selected service. The program takes user input using the Java Scanner class and includes switch statements for each option.
